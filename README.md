# Vehicle-control-system-in-the-parking-lot

In Vietnam, automated parking lots are not yet diverse and are present in many urban areas. => Unnecessary labor consumption
=> That's why this project proposes a smart parking model that can control the number of cars in the parking lot and coordinate the number of cars entering and leaving the parking lot automatically, helping to reduce the amount of unnecessary worker

In this project, we use Arduino UNO, obstacle sensor and RFID module to control vehicles entering and leaving the parking lot and count the number of empty spaces in the parking lot displayed on a 16x2 LCD LED screen.
